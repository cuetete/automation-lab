           Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
                             Version 1.2.2
                          

The Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment contains the Java virtual machine, 
runtime class libraries, and Java application launcher that are 
necessary to run programs written in the Java progamming language. 
It is not a development environment and does not contain development 
tools such as compilers or debuggers. For development tools, use the 
Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition.  The Java 2 SDK version 1.2.2 is available 
for free download from the Java Software web site:

   http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/

The Win32 version of the Java 2 Runtime Environment includes the Java 
Plug-in product which enables support for the Java 2 platform on 
recent releases of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. 
When you install the Java 2 Runtime Environment, you can install the 
Plug-in as well. For more information, including information about the 
Java Plug-in for Solaris, see the Plug-in web page at 
http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/.

The Win32 version of the Java 2 Runtime Environemnt includes a

=======================================================================
     Deploying Applications with the Java 2 Runtime Environment
=======================================================================

A Java-technology application, unlike an applet, cannot rely on a web 
browser for installation and runtime services. When you deploy an  
application written in the Java programming language, your software 
bundle will probably consist of the following parts: 

            Your own class, resource, and data files. 
            A runtime environment. 
            An installation procedure or program. 

You already have the first part, of course. The remainder of this
document covers the other two parts. See also the Notes for Developers 
page on the Java Software web site:

     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/runtime.html

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Runtime Environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run your application, a user needs a Java virtual machine, the Java 
platform core classes, and various support programs and files. This 
collection of software is known as a runtime environment. 

The Java 2 SDK software can serve as a runtime environment. However, 
you probably cannot assume your users have the Java 2 SDK software 
installed, and your Java 2 SDK software license doesn't allow you to 
redistribute SDK software files. 

To solve this problem, Sun provides the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
as a free, redistributable runtime environment, available for Win32 and 
Solaris systems. (The Java 2 runtime environment should not be confused 
with the Java 2 SDK's own internal, non-redistributable version of the 
runtime environment housed in the jdk1.2.2/jre directory.)  

The Win32 version of the Java 2 Runtime Environment comes with a 
built-in installation program suitable for end-users. Solaris versions 
require the developer to provide installation support. 

The Java 2 Runtime Environment for Win32 is available both with and 
without international support. The non-international version is much 
smaller, but is suitable only for English-speaking users. 

The final step in the deployment process occurs when the software is 
installed on individual user system. Installation consists of copying 
software onto the user's system, then configuring the user's system to 
support that software. 

This step includes installing and configuring the runtime environment. 
If you use the Java 2 Runtime Environment, you must make sure that your 
installation procedure never overwrites an existing installation, unless 
the existing runtime environment is an older version. 

The Win32 version of the Java 2 Runtime Environment is distributed as a 
self-installing executable. A simple way to redistribute the Java 2 
Runtime Environment is to include this executable in your software 
bundle. You can then have your installation program run the executable, 
or simply instruct the user to install the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
before installing the rest of your bundle. 

The Win32 installation program records program information in the 
Windows Registry. This registry information includes the software 
version, which you should compare with the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
version in your software bundle. For more information, refer to the 
Notes for Developers on the Java Software web site:

     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/runtime.html 

A more sophisticated approach is to install the Java 2 Runtime
Environment on your own system, then copy the files you need into your 
own installation set for redistribution. If you choose this approach, 
you must include all files except those described as "optional" in the 
"Redistrubition of the Java 2 runtime environment" section of this 
README. The Java 2 Runtime Environment software can only be 
redistributed if all "required" files are included. See the LICENSE 
file for specifics. 

If you use this approach, your installation program should copy the 
Java 2Runtime Environment files into the same directory where your 
application is installed. In effect, then, your application will have 
its own "private" copy of the Java 2 Runtime Environment. 

The Win32 Java 2 Runtime Environment now includes Java Plug-in software, 
which enables Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer to 
support the Java 2 platform. To develop applets that use Java Plug-in 
software, see the Java Plug-in product page on the Java Software web 
site:

     http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/

You can also find information about the Java Plug-in for Solaris on 
this web page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Winsock Deployment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If your application uses the networking classes, it may not run 
reliably under Winsock 1.1. If your networking application must support 
Windows 95, which includes Winsock 1.1, you will want to include a 
Winsock 2.0 install in your installation procedure. (Windows NT 4.0 and 
Windows 98 include Winsock 2.0.) You can download the Winsock 2.0 
from this address: 

http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wuadmintools/s_wunetworkingtools/w95sockets2/

The following URL contains information about how to determine if 
the Winsock 2.0 components are installed on a Windows 95 platform:

=======================================================================
         Redistribution of the Java 2 Runtime Environment
=======================================================================

The term "vendors" used here refers to licensees, developers, and 
independent software vendors (ISVs) who license and distribute the 
Java 2 Runtime Environment with their programs.

Vendors may not redistribute this Java 2 Runtime Environment except in 
the limited circumstances described in the accompanying Binary Code 
License agreement, contained in the LICENSE file in the download 
bundle. 

Vendors must follow the terms of the Binary Code License agreement  
which include, among others:

 - Arbitrary subsetting of the Java 2 Runtime Environment is not 
   allowed. See the section below entitled "Required vs. Optional Files" 
   for those files that may be optionally omitted from redistributions 
   of the runtime environment. 

 - Vendors must include in your product's license the provisions called 
   out in the Binary Code license.

Vendors may also optionally include some specific files from the Win32 
version of the Java 2 SDK in their redistributions of the Win32 version 
of the Java 2 Runtime Environment. The SDK files that may be 
redistributed with the Runtime Environment are listed below in the 
subsection "Redistribution of Java 2 SDK Files".

Vendors may also optionally choose to include the Java HotSpot 
Performance Engine with their redistributions of the Java 2 Runtime 
Environment.  See subsection "Redistributing the Java HotSpot 
Performance Engine" below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Required vs. Optional Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Licensees must follow the terms of the accompanying LICENSE.  

The files that make up the Java 2 Runtime Environment are divided into 
two categories: required and optional.  Files that are marked 
"optional" here do not need to be included in redistributions of the 
Java 2 Runtime Environment.  

The following sections contain lists of the files, for both Win32 
and Solaris platforms, that optionally may be omitted from 
redistributions with the Java 2 Runtime Environment.  All files not 
in these lists of optional files must be included in redistributions 
of the runtime environment.

The Java 2 Runtime Environment includes the bin and lib directories 
which both must reside beneath the same top-level directory. All paths 
given in the file lists below are relative to this top-level directory.

Note that in the case of the Win32 Java 2 Runtime Environment, the 
native code C runtime library, msvcrt.dll, is located in the Windows 
system directory. The location of this directory varies on different 
operating systems, but is usually

   - winnt\system32 on Windows NT
   - windows98\system on Windows 98
   - windows\system on Windows 95

This file should be included in redistributions of the Win32 version 
of the Java 2 Runtime Environment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Win32 Optional Files and Directories
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
All font properties files in the lib directory other than the default 
lib\font.properties file are optional, and vendors may choose not to 
include them in redistributions of the Java 2 Runtime Environment. In 
addition, the following may be optionally excluded from 
redistributions:

bin\beans.ocx		      
   Plugin ActiveX control
lib\jaws.jar		      
   Plugin classes
lib\i18n.jar                  
   Character conversion classes and all other locale support
lib\ext\                      
   Directory containing extension jar files
bin\symcjit.dll               
   JIT compiler
bin\rmid.exe
   Java RMI Activation System Daemon
bin\rmiregistry.exe
   Java Remote Object Registry
bin\tnameserv.exe
   Java IDL Name Server
bin\keytool.exe
   Key and Certificate Management Tool
bin\policytool.exe
   Policy File Creation and Management Tool


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solaris Optional Files and Directories
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The directory referred to as <sys> in the list below varies depending 
on the hardware architecture implementation.  It will be either sparc 
or i386. The Solaris version of the Java 2 Runtime Environment ships 
with support for both green threads and native threads. (For 
information on these two threading options, see 
http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/threads.html)  
Files providing this threading support are in the directories 
lib/<sys>/green_threads and lib/<sys>/native_threads respectively.  
Although at least one of these directories and its contents must be 
included in redistributions of the Java 2 Runtime Environment, vendors 
do not have to include both. 

All font properties files in the lib directory other than the default 
lib/font.properties file for Solaris 2.6 and the default 
lib/font.properties.5.5.1 file for Solaris 2.5.1 are optional, and 
vendors may choose not to include them in redistributions of the 
Java 2 Runtime Environment. In addition, the following may be 
optionally excluded from redistributions:

lib/i18n.jar                  
   Character conversion classes and all other locale support
lib/<sys>/libsunwjit.so       
   JIT compiler
lib/ext/                      
   Directory containing extension jar files
bin/rmid
   Java RMI Activation System Daemon
bin/rmiregistry
   Java Remote Object Registry
bin/tnameserv
   Java IDL Name Server
bin/keytool
   Key and Certificate Management Tool
bin/policytool
   Policy File Creation and Management Tool


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Redistribution of Java 2 SDK Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, may not be redistributed. However, 
the limited set of files from the Win32 version of the SDK listed below 
may be included in vendor redistributions of the Win32 version of the 
Java 2 Runtime Environment.  All paths are relative to the top-level 
directory of the SDK.

 - jre/lib/cmm/PYCC.pf
      Color-management profile. This file is required only if the 
      Java 2D API is used to perform color map conversions.

 - All .ttf font files in the jre/lib/fonts directory. Note that the 
   LucidaSansRegular.ttf font is already contained in the Java 2 
   Runtime Environment, so there is no need to bring that file over 
   from the SDK. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Redistributing the Java(TM) HotSpot Performance Engine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 of the Java HotSpot Performance Engine is available for 
use with the Java 2 Runtime Environment.  The Java HotSpot Performance 
Engine and related documentation can be obtained from 

   http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/

Vendors may include the Java HotSpot Performance Engine in their 
redistributions of the Java 2 Runtime Environment in accordance with 
the binary code license of the Java HotSpot Performance Engine. The 
license is available at

   http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/launch/LICENSE.txt

Installation instructions are contained in the Java HotSpot 
Performance Engine web site.

After the Performance Engine is placed in the Runtime Environment, the 
Runtime Environment will use it by default. The Performance Engine acts 
as a replacement for the virtual machine that ships with the 
Java 2 Runtime Environment.  

For Win32 systems:
The JIT compiler (bin\symcjit.dll) works only in conjunction with the 
standard virtual machine (the bin\classic\jvm.dll library). Therefore 
if the bin\classic\jvm.dll is excluded from a redistribution of the 
Runtime Environment, it would normally make sense to also exclude the 
bin\symcjit.dll file.
